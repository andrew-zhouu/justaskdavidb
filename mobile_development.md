# Learning Mobile Development 

## Introduction
Mobile development is essentially software creation for smartphones, tablets, 
and digital assistants; it mostly works with the Android and iOS operating systems. 
This document briefly goes over what I have learned and what I have accomplished when 
it comes to learning mobile development on Android through Google's Online Training. 

### My Background 
Before joining JustAskDavidB’s coaching program, I had no prior programming or development experience. 
I’m currently in my senior year of high school, and I’m able to learn about programming and development 
before I reach college, and that will help me understand my computer science classes a lot. So far, 
I’ve learned about different data types such as Int, Double, Boolean, String, and Float.

### [LinkedIn Learning](https://learning.linkedin.com/)
LinkedIn Learning offers a broad selection of expert tutorials and courses via video lessons, tests, and 
certificates, enabling users to enhance their skills and advance in their careers, fostering professional and personal growth. 
Though there is a lot of information to learn on LinkedIn when it comes to learning Kotlin, 
the videos I tried to learn from were not only outdated but quite vague when it came to teaching me how to learn and use Kotlin. 

### Kotlin
Kotlin is a programming language that was developed by JetBrains. It's well known for its compatibility with Java while also 
helping with many programming errors as you work, which also makes it a popular programming language when it comes to Android app development.

### [Google’s Online Training](https://developer.android.com/)
While learning from Google’s Online Training I was able to create my first app on Android Studio,
and it was a lot less complicated than I thought it would be. Currently, I’m learning more about how I can progress in my app development.
Creating your first app takes a lot of patience and understanding of “what does what”. Google’s Online Training does provide instructions as you progress through the courses, which helps a lot, especially if you lack experience.
