# Learning Mobile Development 

## My Background 
Before joining JustAskDavidB’s coaching program, I had no prior programming or development experience. 
I’m currently in my senior year of high school, and I’m able to learn about programming and developing 
before I reach college, and this’ll help me understand my computer science classes a lot. So far, 
I’ve learned about different data types such as Int, Double, Boolean, String, and Float.

## [LinkedIn Learning](https://learning.linkedin.com/)
LinkedIn Learning offers a broad selection of expert tutorials and courses via video lessons, tests, and 
certificates, enabling users to enhance their skills and advance in their careers, fostering professional and personal growth. 
Though there is a lot of information to learn on LinkedIn, when it came to learning Kotlin, 
the videos I tried to learn from were not only outdated but quite vague when it came to teaching me how to learn and use Kotlin. 

## Kotlin
Kotlin is a programming language that was developed by JetBrains. Its well known for its compatibility with Java while also 
helping with many programming errors as you work, which also makes it a popular programming language when it comes to Android app development.
