# Introduction to Queues and Stack Structures  
Queues and stack are data structures that differ when it comes to the modification of data. The principle for queues is the data that is first in, gets out first. For stacks, the principle is last in, first out. 
A queue can be visualized as a sequence of rectangular boxes arranged from left to right with random objects (data) in each one.  With a stack, the same rectangle boxes are arranged bottom to top similar to a stack of paper. Queues and stack structures have their own trade-offs and they both play vital roles in the computer science.

### Queues
Queues operate on the principle that the first data to be inserted is the first data to be deleted.  Data is inserted at the end of the list and deleted at the front of the list. You can see this principle applied bank tellers service customers that enter the customer service line -- customers service in the order they entered the line.  Queues advantages or disadvantages, depending on the use. For example, queues are advantageous when managing text messages you send a friend. Additionally, data elements have to be deleted in order for new data to be added. The insertion and deletion of data in the middle of a queue can also be quite time consuming. Queues are excellent at regulating priorities such as with regards to a traffic flows. Printer queues and messaging are also common uses of queues that take advantage of its first come first serve principle.

### Stacks
However, stack structures have slightly differing advantages and disadvantages against queues because of the nature of stacks. Stacks are great at backtracking and reviewing historical events as the data on the top can just be deleted or reviewed. The access of more buried data in a stack structure can also prove to be tedious, as data at the middle or bottom of the stack can only be accessed if the data above it is removed. Again stacks are great if you are trying to review historical information.

### Recap
Overall, queues and stack structures are essential for many of the operations in modern computer science, and they each have their own unique traits. Queues are the same concept as lines in a store, and stacks can be compared to a stack of plates. Although the principles of queues and stacks are ordinary, the application of these concepts can lead to many different possibilities in computer science.
