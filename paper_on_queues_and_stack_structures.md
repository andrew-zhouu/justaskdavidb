# Introduction to Queues and Stack Structures  
Queues and stack structures are data structures that differ when it comes to the modification of data. 
The principle for queues is the data that is first in, gets out first. For stacks, the principle is last in, first out. 
A good visualization would be that a queue is a rectangular data structure that manages data from left to right or vice versa, such as a line of people, while a stack is structured similarly to a stack of paper that is managed starting from the top. 
Queues and stack structures have their own trade-offs, but they both play vital roles in the function of computer science.

### Queues
Queues operate on the principle that the first data to be inserted is the first data to be deleted. 
Data is inserted at the end of the list and deleted at the front of the list. This key difference leads to many service is used by multiple customers, so an order is formed based on which customer was first. 
Queues advantages or disadvantages, depending on the use. For example, queues are advantageous when one are also excellent at managing many different programs at once because of its adept control over data. 
However, disadvantages inevitably arise from the ease of controlling large amounts of data at once; queues have limited space, and the maximum size of a queue is required to be defined prior. 
Additionally, data elements have to be deleted in order for new data to be added. The insertion and deletion of data in the middle of a queue can also be quite time consuming.

### Stacks
However, stack structures have slightly differing advantages and disadvantages. Because of the nature of stack structures, backtracking and redoing history is fairly simple, as the data on the top can just be deleted or removed. 
Additionally, stack structures have fast access times and utilize memory efficiently because it stores data in one block of memory, as opposed to other data structures. 
However, stack structures also have their disadvantages. This aspect is similar to queues, as stack structures also struggle with limited capacity, and the oversaturation of data will lead to stack overflow, which leads to loss of data. 
The access of more buried data in a stack structure can also prove to be tedious, as data at the middle or bottom of the stack can only be accessed if the data above it is removed. 

### Compare and Contrast
Additionally, these advantages and disadvantages of stack structures work advantageously when it comes to the uses of stack structures. For example, stack structures are used for order of operation when evaluating math problems. 
The advantages of stack structures, like fast access times, as well as the disadvantages of stack structures, such as buried data like addition being difficult to access unless the top data is cleared, both work in favor of stack structuresâ€™ application. 
Backtracking and reversal of a list are also common uses of stack structures. However, queues have different uses from stack structures due to their fundamental differences in handling data. 
For instance, the allocation of resources can be prioritized easier, as well as task scheduling. Queues are excellent at regulating priorities in general, such as traffic flows. 
Printer queues and messaging are also common uses of queues that take advantage of its first come first serve principle.

### Recap
Overall, queues and stack structures are essential for many of the operations in modern computer science, and they each have their own unique traits. 
Queues are the same concept as lines in a store, and stacks can be compared to a stack of plates. Both uses are used uniquely and efficiently according to their individual basic concept. 
Although the principles of queues and stacks are ordinary, the application of these concepts can lead to many different possibilities in computer science and beyond.
