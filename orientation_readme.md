# Orientation : Welcome to your first day!

This document was made to help newcomers set up all the software that they will need to actively learn and participate in the JustAskDavidB Coaching Program.


##  Downloading and Setting Up Software

### Jetbrain
We use Jetbrain products for web development.  
This includes PHPStorm for PHP development, DataGrip for SQL and database interaction, and Pycharm for Python development.
Downloading the trials is fine because a JetBrain license will be purchased for you as part of the JustAskDavidB Coaching Program.  
  You will receive an email from JetBrains to complete your registration within the first 15-days.  
  Registration link is below in case it does not appear in the email.  
  [Jetbrain Login Page](https://account.jetbrains.com/login)  
  After logging into JetBrains, “Authorization Successful” should appear on screen.

#### 1. [PHPStorm](https://www.jetbrains.com/phpstorm/download/#section=windows)

  Download the program for your OS and run through the installation.
  After installing Pycharm, open Pycharm and run through the setup wizard. 
  Do not worry there are no wrong answers :)
