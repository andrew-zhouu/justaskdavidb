# The Best Monitor for Programming and Productivity  
I've been helping a friend set up a new workspace for programming and productivity, and they've asked me to recommend some equipment.   
The main focus was getting the correct monitor. After comparing the different setups, I think the following would be a great fit for their needs and budget:

## Equipment	| My opinion
- **Monitor**

- The LG 34WP65G-B UltraWide monitor is a great choice for programmers who need a lot of screen space and accurate color reproduction. The 34-inch IPS panel screen has a resolution of 3440 x 1440, which is perfect for working on multiple documents or windows at the same time. The monitor also has a wide viewing angle of 178 degrees, so you can view the screen from almost any angle without losing any color or contrast.
    - I like this monitor because it has a large screen size and a high resolution, which will be great for my friend who likes to multitask. It also has a wide viewing angle, so they can share their screen with others easily. Additionally, the monitor is VESA compatible, so they can mount it on a wall or arm if they want to save space.

- **Webcam**

- The Logitech C922 webcam is a great choice for video calls and presentations. The webcam has a high resolution of 1080p, which is perfect for making sure that they look their best on video calls. The webcam also has a built-in microphone, so they don't need to worry about using a separate microphone.

- The Edifier R1280T speakers are a great choice for those who want clear and balanced sound for their PC. The speakers have a frequency response of 48 Hz to 20 kHz, which covers the entire audible range. The speakers also have a power output of 2 x 12 W RMS, which is enough power to fill a medium-sized room with sound.
    - I like these speakers because they have clear and balanced sound, and they're also a good price. They're perfect for my friend who likes to listen to music while they work. The speakers also have a Bluetooth connection, so they can easily connect to their phone or tablet to play music wirelessly.
